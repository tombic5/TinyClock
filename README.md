# TinyClock
Very lightweight software only library for scheduling jobs in hours, minutes, etc for Arduino.

Software Clock that reads millis() function and create 24H clock with  values of hours, minutes, seconds and days. That makes easy to schedule daily/hourly etc. repeating tasks without all that math with millis(). Library is very small and optimized for tiny AVRs with limited Flash and RAM. No external RTC is needed.
